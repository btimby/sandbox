        <p>
            This site contains a number of experiments for blocking certain content types under certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of these experiments is to show how user-provided content can be safely served.

            And the second page is <a href="/blocked">blocked</a> from displaying or embedding content.
